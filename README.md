## What is it?

DH Support is a Bukkit/Spigot/Paper server plugin that transmits LODs to connected clients in order to provide a much higher view distance than Minecraft normally would allow. Distant Horizons _will_ work fine without this plugin, but then each client will have to be within normal view distance of chunks to load them, and they will not receive updates for distant chunks when they change. 

## How do I use it?

Just drop the JAR in your plugins folder, forward port 25049 (TCP) to your server, and you're done!

## Is it configurable?

Sure! The default values should be pretty solid, but you may tweak them to better suit your specific needs. Everything you need to know should be in config.yml.

## Can I contribute?

Yes! There are several ways to contribute to this project. You can offer your feedback on Discord, report any issues or bugs you find, or attack an open issue and submit a pull request.
